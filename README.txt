Image Multistyle is a simple clone of the default output style for Drupal 7
Image fields. In addition to specifying an image style to display, you can
choose additional image styles to be *linked* to below the image itself.

This is useful when displaying downloadable wallpaper or other images that
are available in multiple variations. It's simple, but it works.
